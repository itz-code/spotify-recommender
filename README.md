# Music Recommender (CS49)

### 👩🏽‍💻 About the Project
This is my final project for the CS49 (Foundations of Computer Science) course. I combined all of the knowledge I gained about JavaScript and the p5.js library druing the course to create a music recommender that presents users with songs and albums using Spotify iframes from an array. I wanted to involve user input, dynamic visuals, and an interest of mine: music, to create a project that I completed over the course of two weeks.

### 💡 My Inspiration
I listen to music on Spotify very often. I enjoy playing music when I'm doing homework, coding, getting chores done, etc., and wanted to recommend some of my favorite songs and albums to my peers and instructors from CS49.
